  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  
  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm with better Time complexity is considered more efficient because it can handle larger inputs in a reasonable time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory or storage space that an algorithm requires during its execution. For example, an algorithm may have a Space Complexity of O(n), which means the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.
