	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. 
        It helps us determine how <strong>efficient</strong> an algorithm is when processing large amounts of data. 
        Understanding time complexity is crucial for writing optimized code.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to its input size. 
        For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input. 
        Analyzing <b>Space Complexity</b> helps in developing memory-efficient programs.
